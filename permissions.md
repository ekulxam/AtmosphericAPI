Discord: @thecordicus (https://github.com/CordicusC)
- Permission was granted to thecordicus in January 2025 to use this library IF NECESSARY to create a custom totem item
- Weak permission (an alternative solution was already found)
ModFest (https://modfest.net/, https://github.com/ModFest)
- (Re)Distribution by ModFest is permitted
  - This is assuming that this library is bundled in another mod. Extracting the bundled library is not allowed.
- (Production) Usage by ModFest in Minecraft modpacks is permitted (as long as the library is bundled in one of my mods).
Everyone
- By using one of my mods that includes and/or depends on this library, you are allowed to use this library in a production environment to play Minecraft as necessary.
- Developer usage: Contact me, and we can figure something out. (Why would you want to use this library anyway? It's a mess.)
